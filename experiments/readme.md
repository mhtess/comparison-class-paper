## Experiments

In this folder, you will find html/js/css code to run the three tasks reported in the paper. 
Tasks 1 and 2 (NP Elicitation and Comparison Class Inference) are written using a minimal html/js template and can be viewed by simply opening the `.html` file in a browser.

Task 3 (Adjective Endorsement) was written using the [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/) infrastructure. For this reason, files for Task 3 (Adjective Endorsement) are found in their own folder (`adj-endorsement`). 
The task can be viewed by opening `index.html` in a browser.
Instructions regarding debugging and deployment of that experiment can be found in that folder.
